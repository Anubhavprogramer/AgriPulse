A Flutter app for monitoring soil temperature and moisture using a Bluetooth-enabled device, with Firebase integration and offline caching.

---

## Features

- **Bluetooth Integration:** Scan and connect to a soil sensor device (mocked if hardware is unavailable).

- **Firebase Integration:** Store readings securely in Firestore, with user authentication (email/password).
- **Reports & History:** View the latest reading and a history of past readings, including a graph.
- **Offline Caching:** Last reading is available even without internet.
- **Modern UI:** Clean, responsive interface with tab navigation.

### 4. Firebase Setup

- Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Add an Android app (and/or iOS app) to your Firebase project.
- Download `google-services.json` (Android) or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS).

## Usage

- **Login/Signup:** Register or sign in with your email and password.
- **Dashboard:** Use the "Test" button to fetch a new reading (mocked if no device is connected). Use "Reports" to view the latest reading.
- **History:** View a graph and list of all past readings.
- **Offline:** The last reading is cached and shown if offline.

## Bluetooth Integration

- The app uses a `BluetoothService` abstraction.
- If no hardware is available, mock data is used.
- When you have a real device, update `BluetoothService` to scan, connect, and read from your sensor.
